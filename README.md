Version 4 (random) - Created from cryptographically-strong random values
Version 1 (timestamp) - Created from the system clock (plus random values)
Version 5 (namespace, SHA-1) - Created from user-supplied name and namespace strings
Version 3 (namespace, MD5) - Like version 5, above, but with a poorer hash algorithm
